# Private AI with WebLLM

Gatehouse watches every AI call your plugins make, whatever the provider. If you'd rather not send anything to an AI company at all, **AI Provider for WebLLM** runs a language model inside your own browser, and Gatehouse tracks it like any other provider, at a cost of $0.

- **No API key and no bill.** The model runs on your computer's graphics chip (WebGPU).
- **Private.** Prompts and answers stay in your browser and your site. Nothing is sent to an AI company.
- **Free and open source** (GPL), created by Joost de Valk and published by [Progress Planner](https://progressplanner.com/). Gatehouse isn't affiliated with it; we recommend it because it fits how we think AI should work in WordPress.

## What you need

- **WordPress 7.0 or newer** (it uses the AI Client built into WordPress 7.0).
- **HTTPS** (or `localhost` on a development site). Browsers only allow WebGPU on secure pages.
- **A browser with WebGPU**: recent Chrome or Edge on desktop work best.
- **Space and memory for the model.** Models download once (from a few hundred MB to a few GB, depending on the model) and are then cached by the browser. Smaller models are faster and lighter.

## 1. Download

The plugin isn't on WordPress.org yet, so you download it from GitHub:

1. Open [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/ai-provider-for-webllm).
2. Click the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**. You get a file such as `ai-provider-for-webllm-main.zip`. Don't unzip it.

## 2. Install and activate

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Choose the zip you downloaded and click **Install Now**.
3. Click **Activate Plugin**.

## 3. Choose a model and turn on the worker

1. Go to **Settings → WebLLM**.
2. Pick a **Model**. The list comes from WebLLM's catalogue, smallest first. Start with a small one (around 1 billion parameters); you can switch later.
3. Turn on **In-browser worker**. Most plugins start their AI requests on your server; the worker lets an open dashboard tab answer them.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

The first time a model is used, your browser downloads it. Keep the tab open until it's done; it's cached after that.

## 4. Check that it works

1. Stay on **Settings → WebLLM**. The status line should read **WebLLM worker: ready** (after *loading model…* the first time). If it says *unavailable*, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
2. **In Gatehouse:** open **Gatehouse → Overview**. The "No AI provider is connected" banner is gone; if the worker is off, a banner says so.
3. Use any AI feature of one of your plugins, then open **Gatehouse → Requests**. The call is listed with provider **webllm**, its model and tokens, and a cost of **$0**.

## How it behaves

- **Keep a dashboard tab open** while you use AI features. With no tab open, there's no browser to run the model, and requests wait and then time out.
- **No background AI.** Scheduled tasks (cron) and WP-CLI have no browser, so AI calls that plugins make in the background fail while WebLLM is the provider. Gatehouse logs them as failed, so you can see which plugins do this.
- **Budgets and costs.** Local calls cost $0, so they never use up a budget or show as unpriced. Pausing a plugin still stops its calls.
- **Speed depends on your computer.** A laptop with a recent graphics chip answers a short brief in seconds; older machines take longer. Smaller models help.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| *unavailable — needs a secure context* | Use your site's `https://` address. On a development site, `localhost` works too. |
| *unavailable — WebGPU is not available* | Use a recent Chrome or Edge on a desktop computer, and make sure hardware acceleration is on in the browser's settings. |
| *error: …* while loading a model | The download was interrupted or the device ran out of memory. Reload the page, or choose a smaller model. |
| Gatehouse still says no provider is connected | Check that the plugin is **active**, a model is saved, and **In-browser worker** is on. Then reload the Gatehouse screen. |
| Requests time out | Keep a dashboard tab open and wait for *WebLLM worker: ready*. Very slow devices may need a smaller model. |
