# Gatehouse documentation

Gatehouse shows you what each plugin on your site spends on AI, stops spending with budgets and hourly limits, and shows which plugins send personal data to AI providers.

## What Gatehouse can and can't see

Gatehouse sees two kinds of AI calls:

- **WordPress AI Client.** Plugins and themes that use the AI Client built into WordPress 7.0 (`wp_ai_client_prompt()`).
- **Direct calls.** Plugins that call Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Groq or Perplexity themselves, with their own API key, through WordPress's HTTP functions.

It can't see plugins that send AI requests to **their own service** (many SEO, page builder and form plugins work this way), or that bypass WordPress's HTTP functions. No WordPress plugin can.

## Gatehouse in one minute

1. A plugin asks for AI, for example to write a product description.
2. Gatehouse notes which plugin is asking. If that plugin is paused, over its budget or over its hourly limit, the request stops here, before anything is sent or charged.
3. Gatehouse checks the request for personal data and records what kind it found. If you turned on redaction for that plugin, the values are replaced with placeholders such as `[EMAIL_1]`.
4. The AI provider answers. If anything was replaced, Gatehouse puts the real values back before the plugin gets the answer.
5. The call is logged with its plugin, model, tokens, estimated cost, response time and the kinds of personal data it contained.

The plugins themselves need no setup.
